        “But Ivan loves nobody. Ivan is not one of us. People like Ivan are not
        our sort, my boy. They are like a cloud of dust. When the wind blows the
        dust will be gone.” (165)
        <br />“I’m afraid of Ivan. I’m more afraid of Ivan than the other.”
        (136)
        <br />
        <br />
        Cold, solid, stoic: limestone and Ivan share an austere nature that is a
        stark contrast to the sensualist Karamazovs who live in slavery to their
        passions. Ivan appears distant and unsympathetic like the jagged rocks
        that form the foundations of reason so that the emotional carnal people
        can run whimsically on top and live their hedonistic lives. Ivan’s
        father cautions that “Ivan is not one of us” as he lacks “love.” In the
        end, the rational will “blow” away and be “gone” and those who truly
        felt all of life will thrive (165). Over many years, erosion wears the
        rocks away and who is there to notice? Ivan contains a profound
        intellect and abilities, but he has no passion and thus makes no lasting
        impression with others. It is these standoffish qualities that cause
        Fyodor to remark that he is “more afraid of Ivan than the other”, the
        other being Mitya who had just struck his father in the face and drew
        blood (136). Mitya was violent, but he was a man in all senses known to
        his father. They were cut from the same tumultuous cloth and the
        emotions and violence established understanding and humanity. Ivan had
        no visible emotions, no humanity, and this cold-heartedness invoked fear
        because Ivan could rationalize anything.
