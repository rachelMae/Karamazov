        “I don't want to corrupt you or turn you from your stronghold, perhaps I
        want to be healed by you” (219) <br />“It was only with you, with your
        help, I killed him...You said ‘everything was lawful’ and how frightened
        you are now” (568)
        <br />
        <br />
        Ivan’s spirit is not unmoving and rigid but on the contrary, like gold,
        he is malleable and susceptible to strong emotions. Not only is he able
        to change, Ivan is desperate for novel ideas and interpretations that
        can strengthen his constitution similar to how gold is made strong by
        combining it with other metals. After thoroughly questioning the belief
        in God to Alyosha, Ivan sighs that his intentions are not to pry Alyosha
        from his God. Ivan hopes he might be “healed” by Alyosha’s faith (219).
        This reveals his great passion for truth and unrelenting need to fully
        understand; Ivan hoped Alyosha had the key to unlock a reasoning for
        God. In his own paper, Ivan argued for the absolute necessity of God in
        history and that faith in immortality drove society forward, but he is
        left helpless to reconcile these facts with true proof of God. Thus he
        calls himself an atheist because he cannot attain faith while chained to
        his own intellect. His words and philosophies return to him bloodied
        after his father’s murder. Smerdyakov, the murderer and servant, insists
        he killed Fyodor “with your help” blaming his actions on Ivan’s notion
        that “everything is lawful” because there is no God (568). The
        accusation wreaks Ivan’s soul and his health declines as he realizes how
        his seemingly innocuous ideas urged a younger mind to rationalize such a
        horrific crime. His pliable soul takes the guilt as a destructive punch
        because he recognizes that he did have contempt for his father, and his
        need to find the faith to strengthen himself becomes paramount.
