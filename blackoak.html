        “‘No, there is no god.’ ...It's more likely Ivan is right” (130)
        <br />“Ivan knows everything. He knew about it long before you. But Ivan
        is a tomb.” (108)
        <br />
        <br />
        The great black oak sits sturdy with fortitude and deep roots; Ivan's
        quiet nature and terse responses establish an aura of firm belief. “No,
        there is no god”: Ivan’s statement to his father communicates a grounded
        perspective. His reason and intellect lead Fyodor to conclude that “it’s
        more likely Ivan is right” to the dismay of Alyosha, the monk (130).
        This is a prime example of Ivan’s steadfast confidence persuading others
        of his position which in this case is atheism. However, others also
        notice his beliefs are rigid and his ability to adapt to new situations
        and other’s emotions is lacking. Mitya recounts that “Ivan knows
        everything” and his perception and intellect is unmatched, but he is
        “like a tomb” and nothing escapes (108). Ivan is holding a vast amount
        of observations and information but his stubborn and established roots
        prevent him from using these treasures: they will die with him.
