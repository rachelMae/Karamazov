        “I accept God and I am glad to, what's more I accept His wisdom, His
        purpose....Yet would you believe it, in the final result I don’t accept
        this world of Gods and although I know it exists, I don’t accept it at
        all” (218)
        <br />“His mind is in bondage. He is haunted by a great unresolved
        doubt. He is one of those who don’t want millions, but an answer to
        their questions” (82)
        <br />

        As the vine stretches and envelopes over all obstacles searching for the
        light with roots a couple inches deep in many places, so Ivan has spent
        the latter of his life desperately combing the universe for the truth
        and thus his confidence and firm statements are a guise to hide a plague
        of uncertainty. Ivan admits to Alyosha that he “accepts God” but he
        cannot “accept this world of God’s” especially because of the suffering
        of children (218). He has planted himself shallowly into christianity
        and atheism, faith and logic, and continues to seek vital soil to
        attempt to plant himself firmly. Alyosha sees Ivan for what he truly is
        and defends him to Mitya when Mitya suggests he is devilish and would
        sell out the family: “He is haunted by a great unresolved doubt. He is
        one of those who don’t want millions, but an answer to their questions”
        (82). Ivan desires the truth more than any other conceivable thing and
        yet he himself imprisoned his soul in reason so that he is unable to
        reach the light. The suffering aflicting his soul is from knowing all
        but lacking the ability to discern the truth.
