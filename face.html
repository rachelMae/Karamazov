      Ivan is the middle son of Fyodor and the first from the wife his father
      loved. He is lofty, intelligent, firm, and cold at appearance which hides
      his passion, love, uncertainty, and suffering. When the novel concludes,
      Ivan had not yet reconciled his dichotomy, however, Dostoevsky intended
      this to be the first book of a trilogy. Unfortunately, he died before his
      aim was realized and so in a reader's speculation, I believe Ivan would
      have triumphed over his struggle and yielded his reason to the appearance
      of God. For he who seeks will find.
