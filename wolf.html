        “He had told him ‘I am not keen on her’ it was an absolute lie: he loved
        her madly, though at some times he hated her so much he might have
        murdered her” (556)
        <br />“I have a longing for life, and I go on living in spite of logic.
        Though I may not believe in the order of the universe, yet I love the
        sticky little leaves as they open in spring.” (214)

        Though he suppresses it, Ivan, like the wolf, loves people and life in
        the manner of a true Karamazov. Wolves need their packs and Ivan belongs
        in his family contrary to their and his belief. The narrator reveals
        Ivan’s indifferent comments about the beautiful Katerina were an
        “absolute lie” and that “he loved her madly” while “hating her so much
        he might have murdered her” (556). This sort of dichotomy is akin to the
        sensualist actions that characterize his father Fyodor and brother
        Mitya. Ivan chains himself to reason, but he admits later that he goes
        “on living in spite of logic” and though his intellect can’t prove the
        existence of God, he still loves “the sticky little leaves as they open
        in the spring” (214). In his core, Ivan acknowledges that he must ignore
        his intellectual restraints in order to love life, and he cannot help
        but to love life which makes him a carnal member of the family
        Karamazov.
