        “Ivan is supercilious” (129)<br />
        “And how has that Ivan won you all, so that you all worship him? He is
        laughing at you, and enjoying himself at your expense.” (81)

        <br />
        <br />
        Just as the owl sits on a lone branch and stares down at the world, so
        Ivan is perceived to be of unmatched wisdom greater than all. Like a
        great horned owl, he walked alone and found his knowledge himself. This
        left him with resentment for the lesser family members and their
        sensualist passions and inept reasoning. His “supercilious” commentary
        and success at university imbued him with the reasoning and eloquence to
        force his views indisputably(129). This is recognized by his father and
        brothers as they realize they do not possess the ability to counter him.
        Dimitri lamented that they “worship” Ivan and his wisdom while Ivan is
        “laughing” at their stupidity (81). Fyodor didn’t actively raise any of
        his children, but Ivan was especially isolated because he was raised by
        books which sets him apart from his brothers. The owl hunts alone; Ivan
        is alone in his thirst for intellectual conversation and desire to
        answer philosophical questions.
